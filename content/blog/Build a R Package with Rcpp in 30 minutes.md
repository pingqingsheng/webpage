<code> Rcpp </code> is package with which you could write c++ code within R. 

You could simply write a inline C++ code in R like this:

<code>
</code>

Or you could save your <code> .cpp </code> file and call the function from R. With this
powerful tool, you gain the productivity of R and the speed of C++

Let's try to build a small package with <code> Rcpp </code>. Take the Poisson LASSO regression as an 
example. I'm gonna to install this model with ADMM algorithm and through <code> armidillo </code> package.
So let's get start:

## Prerequisite
% 

## Build the Skeleton of the Package

## Poisson LASSO Regression and ADMM algorithm

## Build the Package and Upload to Github
